## Responsible Disclosure Security Policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect our users from publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities without a fix by employing a process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period that allows patching the vulnerability and providing an upgrade path for users.

When contacting us directly, we will do our best efforts to respond in a reasonable time to resolve the issue.

We kindly ask for you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, any contributors, or the project iself at risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report the issue directly to me+oss@carr.sh. Do not use public communication methods (such as IRC, Discord, or Github issues/discussions).

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
